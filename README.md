### HOMEWORK COP4466
## The items of your final project are as follows:
```
	You need to create and design a website that promotes and sells products.
 	There will be information about the products and the seller on the site (It will contain details such as product content, features, product image, etc.)
 	The site will have a menu (contains contact, about, buy, support, etc.).
 	When an option in the menu is clicked, it will be possible to redirect to the menu title on the same page.
 	The site will be coded to be responsive design.
 	There will be a site map at the bottom of the site and when clicked, it will be able to redirect to the relevant menu titles/pages.
 ```

** EXTRA: When the page is scrolled down, it will get extra points if it can be created with a design similar to the one in the link. (https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)
